          <h3>Feather by Nujabes - An iconic song from an iconic artist

          <p><strong>Very few</strong> songs encapsulate the feeling of frustration about humanity, but still feeling that not all is lost - there is still hope and optimism. Feather is the opening track from Nujabes’ second studio album Modal Soul, which was released in 2005. Born as Jun Seba, Nujabes was a pioneering Japanese producer, being one of the first people to use the fusion of chill, relaxed Lo-Fi, and upbeat hip-hop, known as chill hop, or simply Lo-Fi hip-hop. He brought it into the mainstream and several artists have followed in his footsteps ever since. Modal Soul has several features from various artists, including Cise Star, Substantial, and Uyama Hiroto. 
Specifically, Feather features vocals from Cise Star, who is an underground rapper from the group CYNE.
The song is famous for its beat, using a six-second sample as the foundation of the song and using it for the entire duration of the song. This technique is known as leitmotifs - short melodies that accompany a person, idea, or particular emotion. Some prominent examples of this are The Force Theme from Star Wars with its arpeggio-style repeating melody, and The Hobbit Theme and ET’s theme. In Feather, the iconic piano riff is an example of this technique being used. 

However, in my opinion, the biggest thing about Feather is the lyrics. As sung by Cise Starr, the lyrics are wonderfully complex and beautifully complement the beat. My favorite line, (in the chorus) goes: “Light as a feather when I’m floating through, reading through the daily news, measuring the heart within the golden rule” This line speaks about the frustration of humanity and even being detached from life, and trying to maintain a moral compass through it all (as referred to “measuring the heart within the golden rule - how strongly does the singer’s heart follow the golden rule, that everyone must treat others the way they want to be treated?). The imagery of being “light as a feather” suggests a sense of detachment from the burdens of life, yet the song remains grounded in reality. The contrast between being blissfully or apathetically unaware (light as a feather when I’m floating through, reading through the daily news) with actively questioning one's morality (measuring the heart within the golden rule), is an example of a dichotomy, one that most people probably face in these politically tense times. The dichotomy acknowledges that sometimes there are challenges with choosing a side or questioning your morality when reading the news and trying to have an opinion on events. 

I personally connect with these lyrics on a deep level. The “measuring the heart within the golden rule” metaphor is very relevant to me nowadays because when I go on the news and read all of the things that are happening, it’s hard to form an opinion because of the sensitivity of the subject, and the extreme beliefs on each side (for example the Israel-Palestine situation). I also connect with the “light as a feather” line because there is so much going on right now that I feel desensitized to the news, that when I’m reading the daily news, I feel light, as there is no weight to the things I’m reading anymore. 





I felt that this picture encapsulates Nujabes’ whole vibe, since the art style is very colorful and detailed, but is covered by a misleading facade of seeming simple. This connects to the song Feather, as objectively it is two samples, one six-second piano loop, and a simple drum loop, however, the lyrics (the colors and images in the drawing), are really what gives the song character and layered, complex meaning. The song is really a hidden gem in my opinion, is relevant today despite being released 19 years ago, and will probably be relevant in the distant future.
