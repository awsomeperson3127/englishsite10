          <h3>Collage + Rationale of Frank Ocean's Ivy
</h3>

            <p><strong>Explain the inspiration behind your song choice.</strong>
The inspiration behind my song choice was one of research. I realized from one of my peers’ presentations that Frank Ocean is a much more introspective and literary artist then I gave him credit for. Therefore, I researched and chose to focus on his song Ivy, which has themes of longing for the past, nostalgia and the impact of maturity. Ivy is rich in poetic techniques and is undeniably a song worth analyzing. 

                <strong>What type of text did you create and why? What are the conventions/features of your text type? </strong>
To showcase my knowledge of Ivy’s poetic techniques, I chose to display this in a collage, which showed pictures related to the themes of the song. The common conventions of a collage include the title, which is usually in the middle or the top of the paper. It also includes pictures that are not symmetrically or added in a recognizable order, in order to display the personality of the author and therefore build a deeper connection between the author, the artist/subject of the collage, and the person that is viewing the collage. These pictures are usually diagonally added and have a polaroid-style frame to accentuate the informality and make it seem like it could be (for example) a collection of pictures of a family on their fridge. 
                <strong>What did you choose for your inspiration text and why? </strong>
I chose this basic tutorial from Canva as a basis for my collage conventions. If you click on this hyperlink, you can see that the image also uses diagonal, not-patterned pictures and has lots of them. I felt that this collage was asthetically pleasing to me and had the mood I was looking for.  
                <strong>What is the context, purpose, and intended audience of your project? How does it interpret, expand, and/or reimagine the song’s central ideas and linguistic techniques? </strong>
The purpose of my project was to communicate the poetic techniques and themes of Frank Ocean’s Ivy in a more accessible way than just simply song lyrics. Therefore, the intended audience for this project is people that may not be able to decipher poetic techniques and decipher meanings through song listening or looking at song lyrics, and maybe visual learners who enjoy visual presentations of things they find interesting. 
                <strong>Explain the meaning behind 4-6 choices you made in creating your project. Why did you make these choices? What meaning / effects are they designed to create? </strong>
The first thing, on the top left there is a grainy, rough textured black picture, while on the top right there is a bright, pastel picture with clouds. This is meant to show paradox between love and hate, youth and maturity, etc, as shown with the contrast of bright and dark colors. This is present in the lyrics: Ooh, I could hate you now It's quite alright to hate me now When we both know that deep down The feeling still deep down is good”, where feelings of hate are depicted as paradoxical because deep down they still love each other. 
Another notable choice I made was in the middle right, a picture of someones memory in a gentle image, representing clouds for their memories. This represents nostalgia at its finest, as it is a cherry-picked selection of happy memories that the brain stores (depicted as clouds). 
Another choice I made was the picture of Buddha statues in the bottom right. This represents the poetic technique of repetition. This is clearly used in Ivy: “I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you loved me” “The start of nothin’” “I’ve been dreamin’ of you, dreamin’ of you…”. The use of repetition in this line amplifies the speakers love for ‘you’ (the person they are referring to) and therefore is a notable technique to represent in the collage. 
The last notable choice I made was the seemingly-infinite road picture. This represents the theme of ‘back then’. The road is used as a metaphor for the past, showing the journey that the person took to get to the place where they are, and they are looking back to where they came from. This theme is referenced in Ivy when Ocean uses Anaphora: Back then... Back then... Back then…”. He emphasizes this theme by repeating the sentence, therefore using anaphora.
